# Disclosure Backend Static

I'm not proud of this, but we're gunning toward a deadline and I want to be
able to quickly iterate on the backend. That means it needs to be 1) fast to
run, 2) written with a programming language I know, and 3) as conceptually
simple as possible.

Our existing `disclosure-backend` project is none of the three.

This project implements a basic ETL pipeline to download the Oakland netfile
data, download the CSV human-curated data for Oakland, and combine the two. The
output is a directory of JSON files which mimic the existing API structure so
no client code changes will be required.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby >= 2.2.2

## Installation

```bash
brew install gnumeric postgresql
sudo pip install csvkit psycopg2
gem install pg bundler
bundle install
```

## Running

```bash
make import    # <- only need to run the first time
make process
# everything is output into the "build" folder
```

## Developing
### Adding a calculator

Each metric about a candidate is calculated independently. A metric might be
something like "total contributions received" or something more complex like
"percentage of contributions that are less than $100".

When adding a new calculation, a good first place to start is the official [Form
460][form_460]. Is the data are you looking for reported on that form? If so,
you will probably find it in your database after the import process. There are
also a couple other forms that we import, like Form 496. (These are the names of
the files in the `input` directory. Check those out.)

Each schedule of each form is imported into a separate postgres table. For
example, Schedule A of Form 460 is imported into the
`efile_COAK_2016_A-Contributions` table.

Now that you have a way of querying the data, you should come up with a SQL
query that calculates the value you are trying to get. Once you can express
your calcualtion as SQL, put it in a calcuator file like so:

1. Create a new file named `calculators/[your_thing]_calculator.rb`
2. Here is some boilerplate for that file:
  ```ruby
  # the name of this class _must_ match the filename of this file, i.e. end
  # with "Calculator" if the file ends with "_calculator.rb"
  class YourThingCalculator
    def initialize(candidates: [], ballot_measures: [], committees: [])
      @candidates = candidates
      @candidates_by_filer_id = @candidates.where('"FPPC" IS NOT NULL')
        .index_by { |candidate| candidate['FPPC'] }
    end

    def fetch
      @results = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(<<-SQL)
        -- your sql query here
      SQL

      @results.each do |row|
        # make sure FilerStateId is returned as a column by your query!
        candidate = @candidates_by_filer_id[row['FilerStateId'].to_i]

        # change this!
        candidate.save_calculation(:your_thing, row[column_with_your_desired_data])
      end
    end
  end
  ```
3. You will want to fill in the SQL query and make sure that the query selects
   the `FilerStateId` column.
4. Make sure to update the call to `candidate.save_calculation`. That method
   will serialize its second argument as JSON, so it can store any kind of data.
5. Your calculation can be retrieved with `candidate.calculation(:your_thing)`.
   You will want to add this into an API response in the `process.rb` file.

## Deploying
This is hosted on Tom's personal server, accessible with an API root of

http://disclosure-backend-static.f.tdooner.com

(e.g. http://disclosure-backend-static.f.tdooner.com/office_election/35)

This means that unfortuately, only I can deploy it right now.
